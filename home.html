                    <h3>Mission</h3>

                    <p>My mission is to craft clean music that is true to life and sparks hope. Maybe it's not always happy, but it's always for the intent of connecting with and lifting others. Saving Susanna Bracklen is just a plus.</p>

                    <h3>Inpiration</h3>

                    <p>The name is inspired from my sister. Growing up, I saw her draw a character and write a backstory. Her name was Susanna Bracklen and she was rejected by her whole high school and ultimately rejected by herself. I want to save her and everyone that feels inferior. Maybe someday, I'll save myself.</p>
